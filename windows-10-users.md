# Windows 10 Users

Our curriculum, like the rest of the web development industry, is heavily dependent on open source software, which traditionally has not worked very well on Windows platforms. If you’re on a Windows machine, we’ve come up with a few solutions for you to put into place before the first day of class! If you’re already on a Unix-based system \(like macOS or Linux\), reading this section will not be a good use of your time.

## Recommended: Windows Subsystem for Linux

First, make sure you have the latest updates of Windows 10 installed. Our goal is to enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) \(WSL\), also known as Ubuntu Bash for Windows 10. While the initial releases had some rough edges, the latest builds should work well enough for what we want to do.

Follow the setup instructions [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/). This option is our preferred option as you still get to use all of the applications you’re used to \(Sublime Text 3, Chrome, Zoom, etc\). However, _**all**_ of your terminal commands \(`git` commands, `node` commands, etc\) must be installed and run in Ubuntu Bash only and not via an `.exe` file in Windows 10, Windows 10’s PowerShell, Window 10’s Command Prompt, etc. If you choose this option, make sure you also setup the next option as a backup.
